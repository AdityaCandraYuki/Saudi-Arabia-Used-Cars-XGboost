# Context
Saudi Used Cars dataset contains 5624 records of used cars collected from syarah.com. Each row represents a used car. Other information regarding each car is the brand name, model, manufacturing year, origin, options, engine capacity, transmission type, mileage that the car covered, region price, and negotiable.

Syarah.com is an online marketplace for buying and selling used cars in Saudi Arabia, with a large and diverse inventory of used cars from different regions, brands, models, and years. For both buyers and sellers on the platform, the key factor that determines the success of a transaction is the price of the used car.

Buyers want to pay a fair and reasonable price.
sellers want to maximize their profit by setting the right price.
3.2  Problem Statement
The problem statement for this context is to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a used car on Syarah.com, and use this model to help sellers set the optimal price for their listings and increase their profit, while also helping buyers make informed decisions about the value of the cars they want to purchase.

#  Goals
Setting the right price for a used car can be a challenging task, as it depends on a wide range of factors such as the condition of the car, the mileage, the brand, the year, the region, the options, and the demand and supply in the market.

This is where machine learning can help. By analyzing the historical data of used car sales on Syarah.com

I want to build a machine learning model that predicts the price of a used car based on its features, and use this model to set the optimal price for a new used car listing.
